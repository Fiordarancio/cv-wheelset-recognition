# A computer vision recognition of train wheelsets
Public version of a project exam for real-time identification of a train wheelset from point clouds.

## Brief
This projects focuses on identifying the position of a train wheelset as poinclouds of a laser scanner are given. A robotic system can use the found information to determine positions of the breaking system for reparation purposes. This is the first part of a pipeline involving robotic systems developed in the PERCRO research laboratory of the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna of Pisa. Datasets use are property of them, so a single sample is shown here.

## Documentation
The project is developed in Matlab and C++, mainly using [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) libraries. For further information and how to use, please refer to Report.pdf
